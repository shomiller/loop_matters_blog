title: Astronomy Programs Rejecting the Physics GRE

An article was [published in Physics Today](http://physicstoday.scitation.org/do/10.1063/PT.5.9090/full/) recently, discussing a recent trend of prestigious astronomy programs either changing their policies regarding the Physics GRE (PGRE), or rejecting it entirely. The article is worth a read -- even for non-physicists -- as it touches on a lot of problems with standardized testing in general. Like almost every grad student I know, I have strong feelings about the PGRE myself, and the article invoked a lot of reactions I thought might be interesting enough to lay out here.

For those who are unfamiliar, the Physics GRE is a 170 minute, 100 question multiple choice test on physics knowledge required by every graduate program I know of as part of their application. The test covers all the core subjects (classical mechanics, electricity and magnetism, quantum mechanics, and statistical mechanics/thermodynamics) as well as around 10 - 20 questions on "special topics", such as particle physics, condensed matter, or other subfields of physics research, designed to reward those who took extra classes or spent a lot of time in a particular research field. The majority of the questions aren't technically difficult -- most of the material is at the level covered in sophomore or junior level courses. That said, answering all the problems in less than 2 minutes each requires a lot of memorization and test taking strategy -- totally disparate from the focus of any good undergraduate physics program.

First reaction -- surprise that astronomers were required to take the test in the first place.
Many astronomy programs totally separate from physics,
speak a different language (often annoying sometimes)
come up with an analogy?

Second reaction was frustration, partly with the article and partly at the number of the arguments against the GRE in general.
For one, I was several times in the article a little confused whether they were evaluating the PGRE in the context of astronomy programs or as a whole -- the problems are certainly related, but different.
I don't think it's a good test, and it has a lot of problems (cite articles about stereotype threat, etc.) also commonly pointed out that it doesn't correlate with success.
But it frustrates me that few articles lamenting the GRE discuss these problems in a broader context. Recommendation letters are quite possibly more problematic when it comes to women and minorities (though I doubt we have any kind of data on this, since it's tough to quantify and there's lots of privacy issues). Smaller schools may get hurt by the PGRE if their students do worse on it, but it might also be a way of students from smaller universities demonstrating that they're no less prepared than applicants from big research universities since it's hard to compare their coursework directly and their faculty are sometimes less well known.
