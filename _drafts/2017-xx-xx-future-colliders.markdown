If you look through all my previous posts on physics topics so far, you'd be forgiven for believing that I work exclusively on dark matter. While I do work with dark matter sometimes and think it's one of the most promising avenues in particle physics in the coming years, most of my work thus far has actually been on particle physics at colliders. In that spirit, I thought it was about time I dedicated a post to one of the most debated questions in particle physics these days: what do we do after the LHC?

Quickly overview current status of LHC and future plans. Maybe discuss the SSC too, pull up the old article from Physics Today.

Discuss different possibilities: proton-proton collider vs. electron-positron collider -- advantages/disadvantages of each?

Maybe talk about the next collider possibilities in particle physics
Outline the main plan in each of them, a rough timeline

Then focus on the debate between CNY and David Gross
