### Prospects for Future Colliders

There are a variety of different plans underway for future colliders, but they can be roughly broken down into two long-term design plans. The first is the construction of a new linear collider to collide electrons and positrons. The second, longer term plan, is to construct a new circular collider tunnel that would first collide electrons and positrons (similar to LEP, but at higher energies), then eventually be upgraded to a hadron collider like the LHC. There are also several different possible sites for these future colliders -- which will actually be built is essentially up to politics and funding abilities, but it's likely that one of each of the aforementioned designs will be pursued eventually.

**At CERN:**

As a lot of the infrastructure and expertise is already in place, CERN is a natural site to consider for future colliders. The linear collider working group there takes the name of the Compact Linear Collider (or CLIC), which hopes to achieve center of mass energies ranging from 500 GeV to 3 TeV. While this is much lower than the current reach of the LHC (13 TeV), it will enable much more detailed study of the Higgs boson because of the clean environment of lepton collisions. Reaching up to 3 TeV would also enable direct production of particles with masses far above the current bounds set by the LHC, where statistics play a much larger role.

At the same time, CERN is also studying the prospects for a Future Circular Collider (FCC), which would require a new ~80 km long tunnel at CERN. The ultimate goal of such a project would be a 100 TeV proton-proton collider (FCC-hh), which would directly probe the highest energies ever, as well as provide enough energy and luminosity to precisely study parameters such as the Higgs self-coupling (MUCH more on this later!). As an intermediate step, the accelerator could be used as a electron-positron collider (FCC-ee) similar to LEP, that would explore energies from 90 to 350 GeV -- high enough to study the Higgs boson decay modes with precision (a so-called "Higgs factory"). There's also an option for an FCC-he, which would collide electrons and protons.

Finally, I can’t help but mention one possibility that I’m personally involved in – the “High Energy” (or “HE”) LHC. The idea in this case is to use the dipole magnets already being developed for FCC studies in the current LHC tunnel instead, nearly doubling the energy achievable with the LHC to about 27 TeV. The upshot of this is that simply replacing the magnets that accelerate particles is substantially cheaper than an entirely new project, and could even conceivably be done in the next 15-20 years. The 27 TeV run would likely replace a significant portion of the planned run for HL-LHC, and would give us a significant amount of data at a much higher energy, where the prospects for discovering new physics may be much improved. This idea is still in its infancy though, and work is just now beginning to understand in detail the benefits of going to higher energy and what the prospects are for the current detectors at the LHC of taking data at these energies.

**The ILC:**

Note more recent prospects at 250 GeV? (and note the history over the last 10-20 years…)


**In China:**

One intriguing and exciting development in the planning for future colliders is the possibility that China might enter the game in the near future. Similar to the FCC designs at CERN, there are lots of plans for a ~54 km ring, somewhat smaller than the FCC design, that would be built outside Beijing. The collider would consist of the Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC), a dedicated Higgs factory which would operate at ~240 GeV, as well as a hadron collider -- the Super Proton-Proton Collider, or SPPC, which would reach energies around 70-80 TeV.

One of the reasons this prospect is so exciting is because it would open the door to China becoming one of the biggest players on the world stage in fundamental physics. While there are a number of extremely influential Chinese physicists in the field (including the namesake of my institute, C. N. Yang), the majority of them have spent a great deal of their career at institutions outside of China. In the past decade though, China has made a concerted effort to enter the stage in particle physics, with several successful experiments such as the Daya Bay, which has produced several important results in neutrino physics. Being home to the largest collider on the planet though, would be a much more significant step.

For these and other reasons, the Chinese collider project has become extremely controversial, with several notable physicists such as Nima Arkani-Hamed and David Gross actively campaigning for the project to happen, and others, including C. N. Yang himself, arguing against the project. Some of this debate was made public earlier this year, when Yang and Gross published their opinions in an editorial form. If you’re interested, you can read [Yang’s original article](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217751X16300532) here, and [Gross’s response here](http://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S0217751X16300544). Peter Woit also highlighted some aspects of the debate [on his blog](https://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=8949). Regardless of what happens with the CEPC and SPPC, the emergence of China in particle physics will undoubtedly be a big factor for the future of particle physics.
