<h2>Resources:</h2>

<p>For those interested in learning more about various topics discussed in this blog, I'm compiling here a short, incomplete list of pages you might find helpful. If you have suggestions, be sure to let me know!</p>

<h4>Particle Physics</h4>

<p><a href="http://pdg.lbl.gov">The PDG Review of Particle Physics</a> - an indispensible compilation of reviews on a number of particle physics topics along with up to date data on the standard model particles and some common extensions.</p>

<p><a href="https://profmattstrassler.com">Of Particular Significance</a> - Matt Strassler's site is somewhere between a blog and a resource, but he has a number of articles with pedagogical introductions to modern topics in particle physics.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/AtlasPublic">ATLAS</a> and <a href="http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/">CMS</a> public results pages have up to date information from their respective experiments. Some of the biggest results from ATLAS are also summarized in their <a href="http://atlas.cern/updates/briefing">Physics Briefings</a>.</p>

<p><a href=https://particlebites.com>ParticleBites</a> features summaries of particle physics research papers and recent news written by graduate students at a relatively accessible level. (See also their sister site, <a href="https://astrobites.org">astrobites</a>.)


<h4>General Physics</h4>

<p><a href="https://physics.aps.org">Physics by APS</a> offers brief summaries of some of the most significant papers published in the APS journals at a much more accessible level.</p>
