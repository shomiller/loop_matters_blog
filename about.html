<p>I’m currently a PhD student at Stony Brook University, focusing on
theoretical aspects of particle physics and cosmology. You can read
more about me and my research on my academic webpage.</p>

<p>Prior to arriving at Stony Brook, I was an undergraduate at the
University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.</p>

<p>I owe a lot of thanks to several other prolific bloggers, especially <a href="https://4gravitons.wordpress.com">4gravitons</a> and <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/">Peter Woit</a> (both of whom previously spent some time at Stony Brook, though we did not overlap), whose sites inspired me to start my own blog. I also received a lot of inspiration from <a href="http://backreaction.blogspot.com">Sabine Hossenfelder</a>, <a href="https://profmattstrassler.com">Matt Strassler</a>, and <a href="http://www.science20.com/quantum_diaries_survivor">Tommaso Dorigo</a>— if you like anything you’ve read on this site, you should definitely give their blogs a read, as they are the real masters of the craft.</p>
