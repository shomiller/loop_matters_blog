Hi Everyone - welcome to the new home of my blog "Loop Matters". I just recently decided to move from Stony Brook's wordpress host to my own site on Github Pages using Jekyll. There were plenty of benefits to using wordpress (it was much easier to get started, for one), but I decided that I wanted more of the freedom that using Jekyll provides. Most of the blog is functional now, and I've imported all the posts from the old blog, but there is definitely still some housekeeping to do, so bear with me on that front.

A quick shoutout to [Joshua Lande](http://joshualande.com/) who put together a really nice guide on putting together a blog with Jekyll and Github Pages which you can find [here](http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole). He made it really easy to install a lot of the more dynamic functionality like comment sections and tags. 

In any case, I hope you all enjoy the new site - let me know if you have any comments or suggestions! More coming soon -- 

Sam
