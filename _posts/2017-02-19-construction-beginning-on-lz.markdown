An unexpected post this time around, but I just noticed the [Berkeley Labs' press release](http://newscenter.lbl.gov/2017/02/13/next-gen-dark-matter-detector-race-finish-line/) from earlier this week announcing the start of construction of LZ - the next generation U.S. detector designed for the direct detection of dark matter. LZ (short for "LUX-ZEPLIN") is the follow-up experiment to the LUX and ZEPLIN-III, both of which used Xenon as a detector medium to search for nuclear recoils from collisions with dark matter particles in our galaxy. Just last year LUX set the most stringent results to date on the spin-independent cross section of dark matter particles under the WIMP hypothesis (I explained the WIMP miracle briefly in my [last post]({{ site.baseurl }}/dark-matter-and-dama-part-i-the-anomaly.html), in the context of the DAMA experiment).

To understand what LZ is setting out to do, it's helpful to first look at what LUX accomplished. Because we know the density of dark matter particles in the local part of the galaxy, we can write down the number of expected signals from dark matter scatters in terms of two quantities: the dark matter particle's mass and it's interaction cross section (the cross section is related to the strength of the dark matter particle's interaction with nuclei). Then, based on the number of recoils seen (or not seen) in a detector, we can set a limit in this parameter space. When we do this, we're essentially saying that if the dark matter particle had mass X (say, 10 GeV/c^2), we know that it's cross section has to be less than Y, or else we would have seen more signals. Since the excluded cross section depends on the mass, we can draw the excluded "region" in the mass-cross section plane, and get plots like this:

![Direct Detection Limits]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/direct_detection_limits_2013.jpg "Spin-Independent limits for dark matter direct detection in the mass-cross section plane, as of 2013. Courtesy http://newscenter.lbl.gov")

In this plot, the upper right regions above the curves are excluded by different experiments. The shaded regions are those that are excluded, while the dashed lines are the expected exclusion regions based on future experiments (assuming they don't see anything!) If you look carefully, you can see that for a wide range of mass values, the limits from LUX in 2013 were the most stringent to date at the time. Their updated limits that were just [released last month](http://physics.aps.org/articles/v10/3) are essentially at the dashed line labelled "LUX 300-day”1.

(Side note: unfortunately, I wasn't able to find an updated plot with the latest limits from all experiments, but the expected curves shown here from 2013 are essentially the same as the latest results.)

On this plot, you can also see the expected results from a full run of LZ - as the article above notes, LZ's biggest competitors are the XENON1T experiment in Italy and PandaX-II in Japan. All three experiments have similar construction schedules and should have relatively comparable sensitivities, so the pressure is on to see who can put out the best results first. This is a great example of competition driving innovations in experimental physics – all three detectors are based on the same principle and use liquid xenon as their detector material, but they will each have a variety of strategies to try and make the most of their results. You can read a bit more about the competition in [Symmetry Magazine's article](http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/lz-dark-matter-detector-on-fast-track) and in the Berkeley Lab press release above.

One last thing that I can't help but make note of while I'm on the subject – if you looked at the plot above you probably couldn't help but notice the shaded yellow region in the bottom left marked off by the thick dashed orange line. These regions aren't excluded, but they denote the parameter space where we expect to see what's called coherent neutrino scattering. When the dark matter detectors reach this level of sensitivity, they'll be sensitive to neutrino recoils off the nuclei in the detector, which have a very similar signal to dark matter recoils. These coherent neutrino scatters have never been observed, but once we reach this region, it will be tough to continue setting new limits as we might not be able to tell whether a signal was due to dark matter or an ordinary neutrino. For this reason, this region is often called the "neutrino floor". If you look carefully, you can see that there is a small space where the expected LZ curve enters this region – it might not be long before we hit this floor! Some research is already underway into techniques that could be used to discriminate between neutrino events and dark matter events - I'll have a lot more to say on these later.

(Update 2/27/17): A new article is out on [Nautilus' Cosmos](http://cosmos.nautil.us/short/139/what-dark-matter-needs-are-new-kinds-of-experiments) from Juan Collar at UChicago, discussing the non-discovery of WIMPs and increasing interest in alternatives from an experimental point of view. It's definitely worth the read.
