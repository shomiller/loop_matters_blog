Welcome to Loop Matters, my new blog about particle physics, science, and whatever else I happen to be thinking about. My plan for this blog is to help myself dig a little deeper when I come across new physics news, particularly when it pertains to particle physics, until I'm comfortable enough to write about it. While most of my posts will be about particle physics or theoretical physics in general, I'll doubtlessly explore other areas of physics, science, and more general topics on occasion too.

A little about me - As of this writing, I'm a couple weeks away from starting my second year of a PhD program in physics, at Stony Brook University in New York. I haven't formally joined a research group yet, but I'm hoping to work on particle phenomenology, with a pretty broad scope of possible research topics (I'll try to describe some of them in a later post). For my undergrad, I went to the University of Illinois, in Urbana-Champaign, where I majored in both Physics and Math. While I was there, I did some research in experimental nuclear/particle physics with the EXO-200 experiment, as well as some more condensed matter theory research, on avalanche statistics in certain types of materials.

A quick note on the title: the "Loop" in Loop Matters refers to the loops that show up in Feynman diagrams, a calculation tool used in quantum field theory. Effects from so-called "loop diagrams" play a big role in a lot of modern particle phenomenology research, particularly in the sorts of things I'm hoping to do research on. The "Matters" is supposed to be a play on "topics" and physical "matter" - the thing that physics studies.

Since my schedule is sure to be hectic, I don't want to make any kinds of promises on how often I'll update the blog - as I said, my plan is to basically post something whenever I end up spending a lot of time reading about something particular - that being said, because of the timing, a forthcoming post on some results from ICHEP 2016 will probably be coming soon... stay tuned!

Thanks for reading - and please be sure to leave comments or email me with any questions, feedback, or suggestions - I also hope this works as a good outlet for me to practice writing about physics, and hearing from readers is the best way for me to make the most of that!
